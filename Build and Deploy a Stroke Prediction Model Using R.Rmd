## Dataset

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient. 

The dataset can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/adnanhakim/stroke-prediction) or can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

```{r}
data = read.csv("healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv")
str(data)
glimpse(data)
```

## Data Preprocessing
### Checking dataset values

#### Attribute Information
1. id: unique identifier
1. gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
1. age: age of the patient
1. hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
1. heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
1. ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
1. Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
1. avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
1. bmi: body mass index
1. smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
1. stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient*

```{r}
unique(data $ gender)
unique(data $ ever_married) 
unique(data $ Residence_type)
unique(data $ smoking_status)
```

### Converting character values to numeric values

As seen in the above values, the character values can be converted into numeric values.

```{r}
clean_data <- data %>% mutate(gender = if_else(gender == "Female", 0, if_else(gender == "Male", 1, 2)), ever_married = if_else(ever_married == "Yes", 1, 0), Residence_type = if_else(Residence_type == "Rural", 0, 1), smoking_status = if_else(smoking_status == "never smoked", 0, if_else(smoking_status == "formerly smoked", 1, if_else(smoking_status == "smokes", 2, 3))))
summary(clean_data)
```

### Handling missing values

```{r}
miss_scan_count(data = data, search = list("N/A", "Unknown"))
```

There are 201 "N/A" values in the bmi column that likely caused this column to be parsed as character, although it should be numerical. Let's take care of that by replacing those values with actual NAs. Moreover, there are a lot of "Unknown" values in smoking_status which we have to take care of too. We see that we have 1544 unknown values for smoking status and therefore are missing a lot of information in a potentially informative predictor. We will have to deal with this. Lets replace those values with NAs.

```{r}
clean_data <- replace_with_na(data = clean_data, replace = list(bmi = c("N/A"), smoking_status = c(3))) %>% mutate(bmi = as.numeric(bmi))
summary(clean_data)
```

### Visualizing the input

#### Heatmap

```{r}
superheat(subset(clean_data, select = -c(stroke)), scale = TRUE, bottom.label.size = 0.5, bottom.label.text.angle = 90, bottom.label.text.size = 3)
```

#### BMI Distribution

We see that the missingness doesn't show clear association with other variables and therefore we can assume this missingness is MCAR (missing completely at random). The distribution is right skewed (long tail to the right) as this is the only variable with missing data (at least of the numerical variables). 

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = bmi)) + geom_density(color="black", fill="lightblue") + labs(title = "Distribution of BMI") 
```

#### Gender Distribution

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(gender), fill = factor(gender))) + geom_bar() + theme_classic()
```

#### Age and BMI wrt stroke

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = age, y = bmi, color = stroke)) + geom_point() + scale_color_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "red")
```


#### Avg Glucose Level with stroke

```{r}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = stroke, y = avg_glucose_level, group = stroke, fill = stroke)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Logistic Regression
```{r}
set.seed(99)  # Set a seed for reproducible results
split = sample.split(clean_data $ stroke, SplitRatio = 0.7)
train = subset(clean_data, split == TRUE)
test = subset(clean_data, split == FALSE)
logistic_regression_1 = glm(stroke~., data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_1)
```

A lot of variables are not significant. Hence we will be removing Variables based on significance level. The least significant variable as seen is Residence_type with a Pr-value of 0.78326. Hence we will remove Residence_type.

```{r}
logistic_regression_2 = glm(stroke ~ gender + age + hypertension + heart_disease + ever_married + avg_glucose_level + bmi + smoking_status, data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_2)
```

The least significant variable as seen is gender with a Pr-value of 0.33212. Hence we will remove gender.

```{r}
logistic_regression_2 = glm(stroke ~ age + hypertension + heart_disease + ever_married + avg_glucose_level + bmi + smoking_status, data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_2)
```

The least significant variable as seen is bmi with a Pr-value of 0.29928. Hence we will remove bmi.

```{r}
logistic_regression_2 = glm(stroke ~ age + hypertension + heart_disease + ever_married + avg_glucose_level + smoking_status, data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_2)
```

The least significant variable as seen is heart_disease with a Pr-value of 0.44624. Hence we will remove heart_disease.

```{r}
logistic_regression_2 = glm(stroke ~ age + hypertension + ever_married + avg_glucose_level + smoking_status, data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_2)
```

The least significant variable as seen is ever_married with a Pr-value of 0.14813. Hence we will remove ever_married.

```{r}
logistic_regression_2 = glm(stroke ~ age + hypertension + avg_glucose_level + smoking_status, data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_2)
```

The least significant variable as seen is smoking_status with a Pr-value of 0.12771. Hence we will remove smoking_status.

```{r}
logistic_regression_2 = glm(stroke ~ age + hypertension + avg_glucose_level, data = train, family = 'binomial')
summary(logistic_regression_2)
```

Hence we get the three most significant variables having Pr-values less than 0.05.

### Predictions on training set and confusion matrix

```{r}
predict_train = predict(logistic_regression_2, type = 'response')
table(train $ stroke, predict_train>0.2)
```

### Accuracy on training set

```{r}
(3274 + 38) / nrow(train)
```

### Predictions on test set

```{r}
predict_test = predict(logistic_regression_2, newdata = test, type = 'response')
table(test $ stroke, predict_test>0.2)
```

### Accuracy on testing set

```{r}
(1414 + 18) / nrow(test)
```

## Plotting results

### ROCR Curve and area under the curve

```{r}
rocr_prediction = prediction(predict_test, test $ stroke)
auc = as.numeric(performance(rocr_prediction, 'auc') @ y.values)
auc
```

```{r}
rocr_performance = performance(rocr_prediction, 'tpr','fpr')
plot(rocr_performance, colorize = TRUE, main = 'ROCR Curve')
```

### 3D Scatterplot

```{r}
with(clean_data, {scatterplot3d(x = age,  y = hypertension, z = avg_glucose_level, main = "Stroke Prediction Scatterplot", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Hypertension", zlab = "Average Glucose Level")})
```
